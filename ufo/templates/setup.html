      <p>
        Hey there!  Welcome to the uProxy for Organizations management server!
        To start, we want to get a bit of information from you to get everything
        set up.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        First of all, if you are planning on using this application with a Google
        apps domain, we're going to need to get permission from you to access
        that.  This will be used to keep the list of users in your domain in sync
        with who is allowed to access the uProxy servers.  The credentials you
        authorize will be shared by any administrators who log into this server.
        If you do not plan on using a Google apps domain with this product, you
        can just go straight to adding users.
      </p>
    {% else %}
      <p>
        You have already successfully configured this deployment!  If you want to
        change the settings, you may do so below.  Please note: submitting the
        form even without filling in any parameters will cause the previous saved
        configuration to be lost.
      </p>
  
      {% if config.credentials and config.domain %}
        <p>
          This site is set up to work with the
          <strong>{{config.domain}}</strong> domain.  If that is not correct,
          please update the configuration.
        </p>
      {% else %}
        <p>
          This site is not set up to use any Google apps domain name, all users
          will need to be manually input.
        </p>
      {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
  
    <p>
      Please keep in mind that this is a much simpler version than what you
      would actually expect to see in a finished version of the site.
      Noteably, this page should include something about authenticating
      yourself in the future (and actually include a way to skip)
    </p>
  
    <a href="{{ oauth_url }}" target="_blank">Connect to your domain</a>

      Once you finish authorizing access, please paste the code you receive in
      the box below.
